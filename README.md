# Hackerearth-Machine-Learning-Challenge-Reduce-Marketing-Spend

Problem statement:
Most SaaS organizations spend a chunk of their revenue for various marketing initiatives - digital marketing, media outreach, search engine optimization, and more.
However, if there’s a way to target a highly qualified set of customers to buy your product, the organization reaps multiple benefits, such as enhanced revenue generation, higher deal closure rates, and increase in profit margins.

Task:
An organization that offers a hiring assessment platform is looking at reducing its yearly marketing spends and you have been appointed as the Machine Learning engineer for this project.
Your task is to build a sophisticated Machine Learning model that predicts the probability percentage of marketing leads purchasing their product, based on information provided in the given dataset.

Dataset:
The dataset consists of parameters such as the deal value and pitch, the lead’s source, its revenue and funding information, assigned points of contact for the lead (internal and external), and the like.
